        <h6><b>Objective:</b> observe real users interacting with an interface
        and interview these individuals about their experiences.
        Create personas based on these users, 
        and illustrate a storyboard for one of them.

          <h3>Interviewee 1</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p class="intpara">Interviewee 1 found the keyboard easy to set up. He was confused 
            by the similarity between the "style" and "voice" buttons, and noted that it was 
            easier to change voice with the dial control rather than the keypad. He found the interface 
            layout straightforward, and thought it prioritized useful features. Specifically, he noted that
            voice, style, and song are prominent while the performance assistant button
             is "cowering in the corner". He also found the LED screen useful, but said he probably
             wouldn't use most of the features.</p>
          <h4>Observations</h4>
          <ul class="intpara">
            <li>Found basic features immediately</li>
            <li>Played with keys and voices but didn’t explore any of the more advanced features</li>
            <li>Gravitated towards sound effect voicings</li>
            <li>Smashed keys to test features</li>

          <h3>Interviewee 2</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p class="intpara">Interviewee 2 expressed confusion at the keyboard's terminology, 
            noting that the word "voice" isn't typically used in music and that "style" should be 
            called rhythm. She felt that the "autoplay song" feature was outdated given modern phone 
            technology and that the song arrangement feature could be more easily done on a computer. 
            She expressed disappointment that keyboard didn't have a midi feature. Overall, she found
             the interface layout crowded but liked the variety of features, expressing that the 
             different voices could be useful when composing music. </p>
          <h4>Observations</h4>
          <ul class="intpara">
            <li>Played more complicated music and chords</li>
            <li>More focused on exploring advanced features</li>
            <li>Stuck to traditional piano and synth voicings</li>

          <h3>Interviewee 3</h3>
          <br>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <p class="intpara">Interviewee 3 found the interface layout straightforward, 
            though he was unsure what many of the terms referred to. He didn't like the 
            speakers built in to the keyboard and wished it had better ones. He also wished
             that the LED screen had better illumination and that the pictures on the keys
              were bigger. He liked the drum kit feature the most, and disliked the metronome
              feature. He expressed that the keyboard would be a good investment for a 
              young musician.</p>
          <h4>Observations</h4>
          <ul class="intpara">
            <li>Played individual keys, one at a time</li>
            <li>Very interested in discovering new features</li>
            <li>Often had visual difficulty deciphering small text and pictures</li>

    <h3>Personas</h3>
    <div class="centered"><h6 class="personascap">I compiled the interviews and observations and used
       them to create personas representing the product's user base. These personas are not based on a specific
      interview, but rather are archetypes that can be used to model how real users with interact 
      with the product.

          <h6><b>Lessons Learned</b></h6>
          <h6>This project taught me that there can be many variations between consumers of the
            same product. Every consumer will have different goals and expect different 
            things from the same product, so an effective interface must cater to their seperate needs.
            When designing, it's important to identify the types of people who will use a product and 
            consider each of their points of view.</h6>
